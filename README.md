POSTGRES_DB=db_dev
```

## Development

In the project directory, you can run the following command:\
`docker-compose up`\
which will then run:\
`npm run dev`\
Which runs the following three commands:

1. Continuously watch for tailwind changes
`npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch & npm start`

2. Run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in your browser.

3. Emulate the firebase authentication during development at [http://localhost:9099](http://localhost:9099):\
`firebase emulators:start --only auth`

If you want to exec into the postgres container:\
`docker exec -it breezechess-postgres-1 psql -U user -d db_dev`
